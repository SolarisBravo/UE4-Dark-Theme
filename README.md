# Work in Progress
Tested with versions 4.25 and 4.26. UE5 may break it, and it has not been tested with older engine versions.

CREDIT GOES TO:
https://github.com/Sythenz/UE4Minimal for the Blueprint icons
https://github.com/larssteenhoff/UnrealThemeModern for the base design
Myself for minor icon adjustments and simplifying the repo

INSTALLATION: Copy the Engine/ folder into Program Files (x86)\Unreal Engine\4.25.

Todo: Improve the Blueprint icons, fix up main toolbar entries such as Simulate and VR Mode, change accent color to blue, replace font.
